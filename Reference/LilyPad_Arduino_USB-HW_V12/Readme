LilyPad Arduino USB

This repository contains all of the design files for the LilyPad Arduino USB.

The "Firmware" directory contains a reference copy of the bootloader; the
"official" maintained version is in the Arduino source project. We'll try to
keep this updated if anything changes.

As with all SparkFun developments, we consider this to be "beerware"- should
you reuse it, please buy us a pint (of beer, orange juice, or braehg) at the
local next time you see one of us.
